	     <p>Hello, this is DigiBits, a fool behind the mask of a generic ‘Tech’-y name.</p>

<p>However, if you are thinking who this moron is, don’t. It’s useless. What’s important is that this
fool writes mostly on CS and Maths. If the articles seem helpful, read and understand. If it is really helpful,
decide whether you want to share it and if there is a mistake, you may want to comment and correct the mistake.
However, if taking decisions makeyou feel dizzy, don’t bother with all those sharing and commenting shit. It’s OK.</p>

<p>However, if you do share or correct any mistake, I shall be grateful. Also, feel free to ask for clarification
in the comments, I shall be happy to help.</p>

<p>Regards.</p>
